He discovered Deep End Fitness, a low-impact water fitness program designed to improve water confidence, build efficient breathing, and boost mental fortitude; It was the perfect marriage of swimming and fitness combined. Kevin is now a certified Tier 2 Instructor & Head Coach with Deep End Fitness, Team Irvine.

                <p>I started seeing Kevin to help increase my strength and endurance in the pool to become a better athlete. His programming was challenging in the best ways. I felt like I could push my limits in a safe, controlled environment, while also having the reassurance that a professional was keeping an eye on my technique to avoid injury. Kevin is adept on land and in the water and was able to cater to my specific goals. Additionally, the workouts were regularly evolving as I improved as an athlete. I continue to surprise myself and exceed my expectations in the pool. The knowledge I have gained through this journey has proved invaluable and I cannot thank Kevin enough. If you are looking to invest in yourself, look no further.</p>

                <p>I had the opportunity to train with Kevin for a year and see him in action as both a coach and an athlete. 
                    As a coach, Kevin planned and facilitated well-organized Deep End Fitness and Underwater Torpedo League group sessions where I always felt challenged, but also safe and respected. This was critically important in an environment that brings a higher level of risk than a typical swimming workout or fitness session.  As an athlete, Kevin is a fierce competitor. It was motivating to train with him and inspiring to observe him coach and lead the Irvine Rockfish UTL team to an Aquabowl victory. Out of the pool, Kevin is knowledgeable. I've had excellent coaches through competitive swimming, high school and college athletics, CrossFit, and over 10 years in the Marine Corps - but I still learned new techniques and tactics by working with Kevin. If I hadn't had to move away from the area due to work, I still would be training with him regularly. 
                    I highly recommend Kevin if you're looking to shatter your limits and push yourself to the next level.</p>

                    I first started working with Kevin Ng in June 2021 looking to get in better shape and drop a few lbs. Not only have I dropped from 315 to 285 so far in 5 months' time, but he has also helped me change my mindset and taken me back to the fundamentals: Eat cleaner, get better sleep, and move my body. I’ve become a better father, husband, and businessman because of him. My whole life has improved from Kevin’s encouragement. Each day I leave the gym after seeing Kevin I have a sense of accomplishment, gratitude, and positivity I carry on for the next few days until my next session. He’s more than a trainer to me, he’s a mentor, a respected peer, and a life coach to help me keep improving for years to come.</p>

                <p>I have been training with Kevin at the pool for 2 years and at the gym for 1 year. I have always wanted to improve my water mobility and to be healthier, but I never knew what to do by myself at the pool or at the gym. Kevin has guided me and taught me everything I need to improve on and pushed me to be better each time. The training is always challenging yet enjoyable and safe. It was difficult to compete with others at the pool at first but over some time training with Kevin I have noticed my performance has improved in the water and people have noticed some good changes as well. 
                    The training environment is great and you can see the result on yourself. 
                    If you are looking to be better than yesterday, it is time to train with Kevin.</p>
